# Reports & Analytics Dashboard Design Refinement

## Overview
Successfully refined the Reports & Analytics Dashboard design by removing the full-page white container, introducing a new bordered container for the report content, and ensuring consistent tab alignment.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Report.jsx - Main Container Restructuring**
- ✅ **Before**: The entire content area below the header was enclosed in a `div` with `bg-white rounded-3 shadow-sm p-4`, creating a large, full-page white container.
- ✅ **After**: 
    - The outermost `div`'s classes were changed from `container-fluid bg-white rounded-3 shadow-sm p-4` to `container-fluid py-4`. This removes the full-page white background and shadow, allowing the `AppLayout` or global styles to dictate the overall page background.
    - A new `div` with `bg-white rounded-3 shadow-sm border p-4` was introduced to wrap *only* the report tabs and their content. This creates a distinct, bordered container for the reports, as requested.
- ✅ **Result**: A cleaner page layout with a clearly defined, bordered section for the reports, separating it from the page header and overall background.

### 2. **InventoryReports.jsx - Removed Redundant Background Style**
- ✅ **Before**: The outermost `div` had an inline style `style={{ backgroundColor: 'white', minHeight: '100vh' }}`.
- ✅ **After**: This inline style was removed.
- ✅ **Result**: Prevents redundant white backgrounds and ensures the `InventoryReports` component correctly inherits its background from the new parent container in `Report.jsx`.

### 3. **Tab Alignment (Confirmed)**
- ✅ The tab alignment in one row is maintained by the existing `nav nav-tabs nav-fill` and `col-12` classes within the `Report.jsx` structure. These Bootstrap classes are designed to ensure horizontal alignment and responsiveness, even when the sidebar is not minimized.
